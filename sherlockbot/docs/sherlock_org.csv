'"Exactly.  She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred.  I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives having any regard for their husbands who would let any man"s spoken word stand between them and that husband"s dead body.  Should I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her."', 'The Valley of Fear'
'"Is it not?  Is it not?  Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession.  The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest."', 'The Valley of Fear'
'"Surely our profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results.  The blunt accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder -- what can one make of such a denouement?  But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories -- are these not the pride and the justification of our life"s work?"', 'The Valley of Fear'

'"And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the woman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on her nose -- that proved to be the correct solution.

'"Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home."', 'The Boscombe Valley Mystery'

'"The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard"s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law.

'"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.

'He smiled gently.  "It is of the first importance," he said, "not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities.  A client is to me a mere unit, a factor in a problem.  The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning.  I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor."', 'The Sign of The Four'

'"There are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows.  Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals.  It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubable men in town.  No member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one.  Save in the Stranger"s Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, allowed, and three offences, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion."', 'The Greek Interpreter'

'"You have probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?" said he.', 'The Final Problem'
'"He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson.  He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city.  He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker.  He has a brain of the first order.  He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them."', 'The Final Problem'
'"You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal.  My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill."', 'The Final Problem'

'"Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers.  All other things, our powers our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance.  But this rose is an extra.  Its smell and its color are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it.  It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers."', 'The Naval Treaty'

'"There are some trees, Watson, which grow to a certain height and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity.  You will see it often in humans.  I have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree.  The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of his own family."', 'The Adventure of the Empty House'

'"Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers.  That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective,--especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals.  But I weary you with my hobby."', 'The Sign of The Four'

'"In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards.  That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much.  In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected.  There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically."', 'A Study in Scarlet'

'"Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner.

'"It"s every man"s business to see justice done."', 'The Crooked Man'
'"There"s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force," Holmes remarked.  "The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men"s  lips.
